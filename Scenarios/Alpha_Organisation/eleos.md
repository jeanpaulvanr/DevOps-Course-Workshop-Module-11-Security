# Eleos: Event Organisation System

![Eleos Architecture](./diagrams/Eleos.png)

Used by **supporters** and **staff** to arrange events and collect donations. It's a stand-alone web-application that runs on a dedicated webserver. It supports multiple forms of authentication: Active Directory for staff and Facebook or Twitter for supporters.

Key activities it supports:

- Maintains a list of supporters contact details & volunteer history
- Processes one off donations to the organisation
- Maintains details of all events.

Reports on donations are kept on the server and a finance assistant downloads a report once a week for reconciliation.
